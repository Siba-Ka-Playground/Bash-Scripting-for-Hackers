 Bash Scripting:
 Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is:
  1.  A command-line interpreter
  2.  A scripting language
  3.  The default shell on most Linux systems (including Kali Linux)

 It allows you to:
  1.  Automate tasks
  2.  Control system behavior
  3.  Chain Linux tools efficiently
  4.  Write scripts for pentesting, monitoring, deployment, and system administration.

 How Bash Script Works:
  1. Script is read top to bottom
  2. Commands are executed in order
  3. Exit status determines success/failure
  4. Scripts interact heavily with:
      Files
      Processes
      Users
      Networks
 
 Basic Format of Bash Script:
  Generally Bash Script starts with a "Shebang (#!)"
  "#!/bin/bash"
  Shebang = Tells the system which interpreter to use.
 
  Bash Script follows the linux commands.

 Running a Bash Script:
  1. Start the Script with Shebang and use linux commands to write the script.
  2. Save the file with ".sh" extension.
  3. Change to executive mode using "chmod +x --filename--"
  4. Run with command "./filename"
